1,  ENHANCING THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES with True Cryostimulation Presented by Nick Peters Technical Trainer for TruCryo
2,WHAT IS TRUECRYOSTIMULATION Rapid cooling to 4C in under 10 seconds Targeted area – localised spot treatment Cooling applied under pressure – 50 bar
3,"ICE PACK – simple, cheap, easy to use. Freezer must be available – limited portability Ice melts! - limited time to use Must be applied for extended period to achieve results –progressive cooling can be uncomfortable  COMPARISON WITHOTHER CRYO MODALITIES"
4,"ICE BATH – ideal for whole-body cooling. Must have access to large quantity of ice/water – not portable Treats whole body regardless of needs – cannot isolate treatment, risk of hypothermia Medical limitations of use – cardiac and circulatory conditions No pressure applied to affected site – limited effectiveness of treatment COMPARISON WITHOTHER CRYO MODALITIES"
5,"CRYO CHAMBER– controlled temperature, whole body treatment. Huge cost – capital costs and running costs Large equipment fixed in place - not portable at all Difficulties of managing nitrogen – expensive to buy and store Medical limitations of use – cardiac and circulatory condition No pressure applied to affected site – limited effectiveness of treatment COMPARISON WITHOTHER CRYO MODALITIES"
6,"SUPPORT FOR PRACTITIONERS– not a replacement for skilled hands. Better results when combined with rehabilitation treatments Precise, targeted therapy TRUE CRYOSTIMULATIONTHERAPEUTIC ENHANCEMENTS Brings forward treatment plan during vulnerability phase following tears. Clients get benefit of earlier treatment – by up to 7 days"
7,TRUE CRYOSTIMULATIONTHERAPEUTIC ENHANCEMENTS Rapid onset of thermal shock enhances natural inflammatory responses and increases rate of recovery Massage and manipulation times can be halved Up to 25% “looser” muscle – saves practitioners hands – enhanced outcome for both practitioner and client
8,Mobility of equipment means it can be used in the field – no delays in treatment. Immediate treatment of systemic inflammation to reduce risk of tissue damage Immediate relief from pain Immediate reduction of muscle tension – allows increased range of motion for faster rehabilitation THERAPEUTIC FLEXIBILITY Sensors in equipment ensure optimal cooling every time. Client safety is paramount Improved client comfort is important too
9,THERAPEUTIC FLEXIBILITY Range of nozzles included allow injury to be targeted preciselywith correct pressure and cooling effect  Feel Good Factor encourages a favourable biological response to the cold stress. This has been linked to improved levels of well-being
10,KEY APPLICATIONS OF TRUE CRYOSTIMULATION Instant pain relief Reduced systemic inflammation Increased range of motion Generalised back pain Torn muscles and tendons Oedema/haematoma Muscle spasms
